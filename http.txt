HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTPS: HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext (web pages) between a web server and a web browser. 
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that encrypts data for secure communication. It is commonly used for online transactions and sensitive information exchange.

In HTTP, theres something called HTTP Request Methods: HTTP defines several request methods indicating the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. The commonly used methods are:

GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
PUT: Uploads a representation of the specified resource.
DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.
PATCH: Partially modifies a resource.

HTTP status code:  HTTP responses contain status codes to indicate the outcome of the request. Some common status codes include:

200 OK: The request has succeeded.
404 Not Found: The server can't find the requested resource.
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition.
302 Found: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.

Headers: HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. They include:

Content-Type: Indicates the media type of the resource.
Content-Length: Indicates the size of the entity-body in bytes.
User-Agent: Identifies the client making the request.
Cache-Control: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.


URLs (Uniform Resource Locators): URLs specify the location of a resource on the internet. They consist of several components including:

Protocol (e.g., http:// or https://)
Domain name (e.g., www.example.com)
Path (e.g., /path/to/resource)
Query parameters (e.g., ?param1=value1&param2=value2)
