
The internet works as a global network of interconnected computers and its devices communicate through standardized protocols and technologies. Here's a simplified overview:

Hardware Infrastructure: The internet comprises various physical components like servers, routers, switches, and data centers connected through cables, fiber optics, satellites, and other networking infrastructure.

Data Transmission: When you access a website or send data, it's broken into packets. These packets travel across the network using routers and switches, following the most efficient path determined by protocols like TCP/IP.

Protocols and Addresses: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses uniquely identify devices on the internet. Each device has a unique IP address to send and receive data. Domain Name System (DNS) translates user-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs): ISPs provide access to the internet for users. They connect users to their network, which is then linked to the broader internet infrastructure.

Servers and Clients: Servers store and provide resources (like websites, emails, files), while clients (your computer or device) request and receive these resources through browsers, apps, or other software.

World Wide Web (WWW): The web is a part of the internet where documents and resources are linked through hyperlinks and accessed via web browsers.

Security: Security measures like encryption, firewalls, and secure protocols (like HTTPS) help protect data transmission and ensure secure communication.

In essence, the internet operates through a complex network of interconnected devices, protocols, and infrastructure that enable communication, data sharing, and access to various services worldwide
